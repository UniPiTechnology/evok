# Introduction

Evok is the primary API for accessing I/Os of [NEURON], [PATRON], [GATE] and [Unipi 1.1] devices including [Extension modules] by [Unipi technology].

It provides multiple ways to easily access the I/Os of the devices, including:

- RESTful WebForms API
- RESTful JSON API
- Bulk request JSON API
- WebSocket API
- JSON-RPC API

Besides that, Evok also supports sending notifications via webhook.

[evok-web](https://github.com/UniPiTechnology/evok-web-jq) is a simple demo web application using Evok demonstrating its usage and allowing easy control of the devices configured in Evok.
